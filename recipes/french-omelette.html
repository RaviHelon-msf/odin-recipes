	<ul>
    		<li>Eggs</li>
    		<li>Butter</li>
    		<li>Salt</li>
		<li>Any spices you like</li>
  	</ul>
	

	<ol>
    		<li>Beat the shit out of the eggs. You may add the salt earlier so the eggs feel more of the beating.</li>
    		<li>Butter the pan so the egg cannot stick and regain it's grip.</li>
    		<li>Place the eggs on the pan and keep poking at them. Just enough so they cannot recover from the beating, but leave it on medium heat so it helps aliviate the pain.</li>
		<li>When the eggs start to get hardened by the though life you gave them you can let it for for a while. It has grown into a strong independent egg. Slowly turn off the heat. It doesn't need that anymore</li>
		<li>Lastly, after such a beating they need to roll into a cone so they can have their trauma internalized instead of thrown at random people </li>
		<li>Now that it suffered and manage to get to a stable position in life, throw whatever spices you have at it. It should be able to deal with it.</li>
		<li>Finally, the egg is now a proper egg. Eat him before he gets to enjoy life.</li>
