# odin-recipes
This is my first project of a full stack web-devepment.

This shall be the best website ever know to men. It will contain the most delicious of recipes from Valhalla.

However, as much as anything else, this has to start somewhere and that somewhere is here: The simple project that lies in front of your eyes.

This is nothing much even for midgard, so be patient. For now, I'm just learning the full-stack basics. 

I expect this website to be presentable at the end of this exercise. I need it to be functional. Have at least a 'about' page and links to my favorite recipes. It should have ratings and comments. Maybe video and image evidence of the recipes working, maybe.

I'd say it would be nice to have a history (or more) associated with each recipe.
